**FREDDI FISH FULL SERIES MANUAL GENERAL INFO:**

Current check locations are on major obtainable items and story events (typically involving picking up an obtained item). There is some consideration for the future in adding silly spots like rounds of useless minigames and clicking on silly sound effect locations that Humongous Games loves to do. You will need the save files from this collection to use this manual. The game series has multiple seeds and this was set up for only one of them. You can press S in game to save and L to load. Multiple saves are encouraged.

There are "Goal Items" for each game plando'd into their beat the game locations. Clicking the "Beat the Manual" button requires you to obtain all of them. The currently implemetned ones are:
- Stolen Treasure
- Stolen Toys

You can ignore a lot of the item categories. Most of them exist to help with some logic bits here and there. The currently implemented important ones are:
- Freddi Fish 1, 
- Freddi Fish 1 Endgame
- Freddi Fish 2
- Victory Items
- Series Games

**Because there are some games with point of no return endgame spots, for the full series yaml (or if generating along with other games) there is a chance you will have to replay a game to collect checks prior to that point.** 
I considered including a second save file for each game, but it's Freddi Fish. If you're using escape to go through animations the game is about 10 seconds long. You can always create your own save file before moving on using the S key in game. Current Points of no return are:
- Collecting the Sunken Ship Clue in Freddi Fish 1 at the King's Court takes you to the Sunken Ship Endgame location
- Collecting the final location of a trap piece in Freddi Fish 2 ends the game immediately.

**Freddi Fish 1:** You always start with one random sphere 1 item (simulating the PB&J Sandwich grandma gives you) and the first clue bottle that tells you to go to the beach. For the standalone 1 manual, the items in the sunken ship region of the game are plando'd to be vanilla since it was creating unbeatable seeds otherwise with not enough locations. For the full game variation they are shuffled as normal.

**Freddi Fish 2:** The Trident is currently plando'd in it's own location. Because 2 does not have an end game location and just ends abruptly when you collect all the needed trap items. This allows you to control when that game will end due to its sphere 1 nature. If you don't save it for last, just prepare to have to replay to get locations. While you can trigger the cutscene of capturing the ghost by getting these locations, the check "capture the ghost" is not considered done until you do so after receiving all trap pieces through AP.
